# 📂 Google DocumentsUI App Launcher

This is a minimal Android app that launches the system file explorer (`com.google.android.documentsui`). This is especially useful if your device's default launcher hides the system **Files** app.

Android's built-in **Files** app is more powerful than many OEM alternatives — it can access deeper directories, including those under the `Android/` folder, making file management more transparent and flexible.

## What it does?

* Instantly launches Android's native **Files** app.
* Clean and lightweight — no UI, just a launcher intent.
* Closes itself automatically after launching the system file explorer.
